# hypercard thinkings

Why is hypercard so durable? I do not know. People continue to be interested despite its current irrelevance.

It seems possible that hypercard has some quality that is missing from the web and hyperlinks? What is that quality.

Going out on a limb, one could think that hypercard follows the way our brains more closely than the alternatives. In other words it maps somehow into something that works for our minds. 

One possibilitiy, and only a straw dog at that, is that hypercard - as its name denotes - provides a container for hypertalk items, whereas hypertext is simply a link. It is possible that our brains work from a container view better than it works from the same thing that is not container based.
